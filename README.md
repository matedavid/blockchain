# Simple-Blockchain

### Compile:
To compile the code, you need to install Cmake version 2.8 or higher, and have a c++ compiler installed. Then, follow these simple steps:
1. Run `cmake .` in the root directory (where `CMakeLists.txt` file is located)
2. Create a `bin/` directory (if it isn't already created)
3. Run `make` in the same directory as the first step.
4. Run `./bin/blockchain` and the program will start running and listening for requests.
